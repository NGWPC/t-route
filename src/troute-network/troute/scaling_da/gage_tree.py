"""Precompute per-gage upstream trees for the streamflow DA correction.

For each USGS gage we BFS upstream from its NHF segment through reverse
connectivity, halting any branch that hits another gage segment or a
flowpath inside a waterbody. The resulting tree is encoded as flat NumPy
arrays (segment order, per-segment drainage area, per-segment theta, and the
parent index and confluence flag each node needs) suitable for tight
per-timestep DA loops in :mod:`troute.routing.fast_reach.scaling_da`.

This is the pure-NumPy reference structure that the eventual Cython kernel
consumes; :func:`build_one_gage_tree` is topology-agnostic (it takes a reverse
connectivity mapping, an area lookup, and a stop set), so the t-route network
builder in a later stage supplies those from the real network instead of the
proof-of-concept's Ohio loader.

    """Precomputed per-gage upstream-tree structure for area-scaling DA.

    ``seg_order`` lists the fp_ids in the gage's upstream tree (BFS order,
    gage at position 0), bounded by the stop rule (other gages, waterbody
    interiors). ``seg_parent_idx`` and ``step_is_junction`` carry the
    parent/junction metadata the white paper's distribution needs: the
    correction scales by drainage area (Eq. 2) along linear steps and splits
    between branches by modeled flow (Edge Case 2) at confluences.

    Attributes
    ----------
    gage_fp : int
        Flowpath ``fp_id`` of the gage segment.
    gage_area_sqkm : float
        ``total_da_sqkm`` of the gage segment (the proposal's ``A_o``).
    seg_order : numpy.ndarray of int64
        Tree-ordered fp_ids; ``seg_order[0] == gage_fp``.
    seg_areas_sqkm : numpy.ndarray of float64
        ``total_da_sqkm`` per tree segment (the proposal's ``A_s``).
    theta : float
        The tree's region theta, resolved once from the gage's VPU at build time.
        A SCALAR, not a per-segment array: the linear step telescopes to the
        closed form dQ_o*(A_s/A_o)^theta only for a constant exponent, so one
        value per gage is the finest resolution the method admits. Holding it here
        makes that a structural invariant instead of a runtime check that could
        fail deep inside a run.
    seg_positions : numpy.ndarray of int64
        Position of each tree segment within the *global* fp_id index
        used by the model output (filled in by :meth:`with_positions`
        once the global ordering is known).
    seg_parent_idx : numpy.ndarray of int64
        For each segment, the index (within ``seg_order``) of its downstream
        (parent) segment in the tree. The gage's entry is ``-1``. BFS order
        guarantees ``seg_parent_idx[j] < j``.
    step_is_junction : numpy.ndarray of bool
        For each segment, whether its parent is a *physical* confluence: two or
        more upstream branches in the full network, counted before the stop rule
        prunes any of them. True selects the flow-ratio split (Edge Case 2);
        False selects the area-scaling step (Eq. 2). So a junction with one
        tributary cut off by an upstream gage or reservoir still flow-ratio-splits
        the surviving tributary. The gage's entry is False.
