"""One-time static preprocessing for the simple-scaling streamflow DA.

Everything the DA needs that is a property of the network plus the run config --
the gage crosswalk, waterbody stops, observable-station roster, holdout, source
set, and per-gage upstream trees -- is resolved here once, as part of t-route's
data processing. ``NHF.__init__`` calls :func:`build_scaling_da_setup` when the
DA is enabled; the runtime applier consumes the resulting
:class:`ScalingDASetup`. Callers with a network that did not pre-build (tests,
harnesses) go through the same function, so there is one implementation.

Every guard here fails LOUDLY, because its silent form is a run that completes,
writes full output, and exits 0 while assimilating nothing.
