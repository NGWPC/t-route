"""Per-timestep application of the simple-scaling DA correction.

The simple-scaling DA *kernel*: it lives in ``troute.routing.fast_reach`` beside
the nudging kernel (:mod:`simple_da`) and the routing kernels, mirroring t-route's
split of data assimilation -- the per-gage *tree* setup is built in
``troute.scaling_da`` (troute-network), and the *correction kernel* is here
(troute-routing). This pure-NumPy implementation is the reference for the eventual
in-place Cython port (``scaling_da.pyx``); its hot loop
(:func:`_tree_dq_nodes`) ports line-for-line.

Trees are precomputed once by
:func:`troute.scaling_da.gage_tree.build_one_gage_tree`; this module's
:func:`apply_scaling_da` consumes them and produces both the
corrected discharge time series and the per-segment delta-Q diagnostic.

The gage correction ``dQ_o`` is distributed upstream by the white paper's
two prescriptions, combined as the white paper writes them:

- Along a linear step (one upstream branch), the correction scales by
  drainage area, ``dQ(s) = dQ(parent) * (A_s / A_parent)^theta_s`` (Eq. 2);
  along a chain this telescopes to ``dQ_o * (A_s / A_o)^theta``.
- At a confluence (two or more upstream branches), the parent correction
  splits between branches in proportion to modeled flow,
  ``dQ_branch = dQ(parent) * Q_branch / Q_parent`` (Edge Case 2).

Walking the tree in BFS order (each node's parent precedes it) accumulates a
per-node, per-timestep multiplier ``M`` with ``dQ(s, t) = dQ_o(t) * M(s, t)``.
The flow-ratio step reads the modeled flow at each node, so the correction at
confluences follows the model's flow partition rather than drainage area.

        Modeled discharge, indexed by time with integer ``fp_id`` columns.
        Must contain every ``fp_id`` that appears in any tree's ``seg_order``;
        the flow-ratio split at confluences reads the modeled flow at each
        node.
    q_obs : pandas.DataFrame or None
        USGS observations, indexed by time (aligned to ``q_model.index``)
        with ``site_no`` columns. NaN at a timestep means "no observation".
        May be ``None`` when ``dq_o_by_site`` supplies the corrections instead.
    gage_to_fp : Mapping[str, int]
        ``site_no -> fp_id`` for the gages being assimilated.
    trees : Mapping[str, GageTree]
        Precomputed per-gage trees. Sites missing from ``q_obs`` or
        ``gage_to_fp`` are skipped with a warning.
    obs_decay_tau_min : float, optional
        Exponential-decay time constant in minutes for stale
        observations. When ``None`` (default), missing observations
        contribute zero correction. Otherwise, the last fresh dQ persists
        with ``exp(-dt/tau)`` decay until the next valid observation.
    min_flow_cms : float, optional
        Floor (m^3/s) on the parent's modeled flow in the confluence
        flow-ratio split. When the parent flow is at or below this floor
        the branch receives no correction at that timestep, guarding the
        ``Q_branch/Q_parent`` division at near-dry junctions. Default
        ``1e-6``.
    method : str, optional
        Distribution rule. ``"flow_ratio"`` (default) is the white paper's
        scheme: area-scaling along linear steps and the Edge Case 2 flow-ratio
        split at confluences. It requires a *uniform* theta per tree (the white
        paper's region theta), held as a scalar on the tree, because the
        linear-step accumulation telescopes to the Eq. 2 form
        ``dQ_o*(A_s/A_o)^theta`` only for uniform theta. ``"area_scaling"`` is
        the ablation that applies Eq. 2 at *every* node,
        ``dQ(s) = dQ_o*(A_s/A_o)^theta_s``, ignoring Edge Case 2; it accepts
        per-segment theta (applied to the global area ratio) and is strongly
        theta-dependent, over-correcting small headwaters. Other values raise.
    dq_o_by_site : Mapping[str, numpy.ndarray], optional
        Stage A (in-kernel) override. When given, the per-gage correction
        ``dQ_o(t)`` is taken directly from this mapping (``site -> length-nt
        array``) instead of being computed as ``obs - Q_model(gage)``. Used after
        the MC kernel has already overridden the gage in-kernel: the recorded
        ``nudge`` (= applied analysis increment, decay included) is the authoritative
        per-timestep delta, and ``q_model`` must carry the reconstructed background
        ``Q_analyzed - nudge`` at each gage segment so the flow-ratio split sees the
        modeled (not overridden) flow at the tree root. ``q_obs``,
        ``obs_decay_tau_min`` and ``decay_state`` are then unused (the gage residual
        and decay are not recomputed). The corrected gage value lands back at
        ``Q_analyzed`` (background + nudge), a no-op against the kernel's override.
    lag_by_site : Mapping[str, tuple[numpy.ndarray, numpy.ndarray]], optional
        Travel-time lag, site -> (in_window, tshift), each aligned to that
        tree's seg_order. in_window is 1.0 inside the smoother window and
        0.0 beyond it; tshift is the advective displacement in whole
        timesteps. Omit a site (or pass None) to leave it un-lagged.
    decay_state : dict, optional
        Per-site ``site_no -> (last_dq, last_t_min)`` decay persistence, threaded
        across forcing loops and **updated in place**. ``None`` (default) disables
        cross-loop decay. Unused in the ``dq_o_by_site`` path.
    time_ref : pandas.Timestamp, optional
        Common reference time for the decay clock; required for the cross-loop
        ``decay_state`` seed to be meaningful. Defaults to ``q_model.index[0]``.

    Returns
    -------
    q_corrected : pandas.DataFrame
        Same shape as ``q_model``. Negative values clamped at 0.
    dq_diagnostic : pandas.DataFrame
        Same shape as ``q_model``, recording the delta-Q applied at each
        segment per timestep. Zero where no correction was applied.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``method`` is not ``"flow_ratio"`` or ``"area_scaling"``, if
        ``obs_decay_tau_min`` is non-positive, or (for ``"flow_ratio"``) if any
        tree is malformed.

    Notes
    -----
    Per-tree corrections are summed into the output; the trees are mutually
    disjoint by construction, and an overlap (two trees sharing a segment) is
    logged as a warning. The confluence split is non-expansive (see
    :func:`_tree_dq_nodes`), so a correction never amplifies across a junction.
