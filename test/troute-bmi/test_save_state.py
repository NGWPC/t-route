"""Regression test for NGWPC-11208: subnetwork must be excluded from save state.

The subnetwork refactor changed ``Model._subnetwork`` from a serializable
list-of-dicts into an ``ExecutionPlan`` object. The old ``create_state`` ran
``list(self._subnetwork)``, which raises ``TypeError`` on an ExecutionPlan (no
``__iter__``). PR #112 drops the plan from save state entirely -- it is a
recomputable topology decomposition, rebuilt from the ``[None, None, None]``
sentinel on the first run after a load.

These tests drive ``create_state``/``load_state`` in isolation via
``Model.__new__`` so they need neither a config file nor a built network.
