"""One config must produce one window partition, on the CLI and under the BMI.

The two drivers each had their own chunking. The CLI filled to ``max_loop_size`` and
folded a short final remainder into its neighbor; the BMI spread the update evenly. On
the same config that is ``[24, 24, 24, 28]`` against ``[20, 20, 20, 20, 20]``, and the
folded window is wider than the memory the caller sized for.

Both now call the functions here, so the partition is shared by construction rather
than by two implementations agreeing.
