"""Unit tests for diversion data assimilation (Old River Control Structure).

The integration test in ``test/nhf/old_river`` needs a subset hydrofabric, NWM
retrospective forcing and USGS timeslices, so it skips wherever that data has not
been built. These tests cover the same machinery with no external data, so the
mechanism is guarded on every run.

What the scheme does, and what therefore has to hold:

The observed discharge at the diversion gage is SUBTRACTED from the donor flowpath
inside the routing kernel. Nothing adds it to the receiving river in code: the gage
sits on a headwater flowpath of the receiving system, so ordinary streamflow
nudging imposes the observed discharge there and the existing topology routes it
downstream. The gage's row is read from the TimeSlices and held for the persistence
horizon past the end of its record.
