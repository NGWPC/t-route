"""Carve a whole VPU out of the NextGen Hydrofabric into a t-route-readable gpkg.

Unlike prep_ohio_data.py, which keeps the upstream subgraph of ONE tailwater, this
keeps every flowpath in a VPU (a whole hydrologic region, many tailwaters). VPU 01
(North Atlantic) is the streamflow-DA forecast demo domain: ~24,862 reaches, ~906
gages, ~834 lakes carrying all reservoir-DA types.

The mechanics mirror prep_ohio_data.py's proven sqlite cascade (copy the gpkg, delete
rows outside the kept set, layer by layer) so t-route reads the result unchanged. The
only real differences: the kept set is `vpu_id = <VPU>` rather than a tailwater BFS,
and the lake / reservoir_da layers are KEPT and filtered, since t-route reads
reservoir DA from them, rather than emptied.

It also writes the exact divide-id list the forcing must cover, which is both the
coverage the NextGen delivery is checked against and the set t-route looks up in the
qlateral input.

    python benchmark/scripts/prep_vpu.py --src /path/to/nhf.gpkg --vpu 01

The dataset is gitignored; only the divide-id list and a small manifest are small
enough to keep.
