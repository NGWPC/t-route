"""Prepare the Tier A benchmark dataset (``nhf_subset_ohio``) from the CONUS source.

The Tier A workload (``nhf_subset_ohio``) is the topological subgraph
upstream of one tailwater within the NextGen Hydrofabric. By default we
use ``fp_id = 1725641``, an Ohio River basin (VPU 05) outlet whose
upstream contributing area covers 11,327 flowpaths (~80,000 km² total
drainage area). It is a "real-world but tractable" benchmark: big
enough to expose per-segment overhead but single-worker-runnable in
~50 s.

This script derives ``data/domain/nhf_subset_ohio.gpkg`` + 144 hourly
synthesized-forcing CSVs from the same CONUS geopackage that
``prep_conus.py`` consumes. One source covers both tiers.

Usage:
    # Once you have the NextGen Hydrofabric CONUS geopackage:
    python benchmark/prep_data.py --src /path/to/nhf_1.1.4.gpkg

    # Carve a different tailwater (use any fp_id from the CONUS gpkg):
    python benchmark/prep_data.py --src /path/to/nhf_1.1.4.gpkg --tailwater 1234567

    # Rebuild even if data already prepared:
    python benchmark/prep_data.py --src /path/to/nhf_1.1.4.gpkg --force

The data set is gitignored; ``MANIFEST.json`` records sha256 checksums.

The source is the NextGen Hydrofabric v1.1.4 CONUS geopackage used by
the EDFS team for this analysis; reviewers with access can reproduce
the numbers in ``RESULTS.md`` directly.
